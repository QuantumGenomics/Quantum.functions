Quantum functions for understanding genomics.

¶ A Quantum functions, or πf in Quantum Genomics, is a mathematical model of quantum theory of the quantum state of a system.
The quantum function is a complex valued probability vector space (amplitude with directions) is s complex distribution of algebraic quantity with finite fields of dense geometry used in to describing the behavioral state of the sub-system and system.


¶ <b>Kumar Theorem</b>:
1. Gene and gene-like is a quantum sub-system with states of quantum functions that exposes the genome as a quantum system.</br>
2. The quantum system of a genome, imposing and exposing their own state of quantum function(s), the expression of the algebraic inequalities, called the energy of the genome, <b>E<sub>Q</sub><sub>genome</sub></b>.
